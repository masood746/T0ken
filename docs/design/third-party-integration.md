# Third-Party Integration
The third-party integration processes enables businesses, broker-dealers, custodians, and investors to utilize tZERO's
platform and services to raise funds for their businesses or augment their security trading operations.

tZERO's trading platform is intentionally designed in modular format to allow for third-party integration through
flexible and customizable setups. Businesses and other interested parties have a range of integration choices
available to them allowing them pick and choose the level of integration and service customization that best fulfills
their needs and enhances their operations.

#### Option 1: Let tZERO handle it.
This option assigns the responsibility for setting up the trading structure to tZERO. In this option, tZERO will take
care of all the necessary designs and setups which include defining the security token based on the client's
specifications and fundraising plans, setting up the required regulatory rule set, engaging tZERO's affiliate broker
dealers and custodian entities, as well as setting up the necessary smart contracts to coordinate the interaction of
all the entities involved.

Using this option, business and third-parties delegate the responsibility for the full set of trading services and
operations to tZERO, thereby businesses lighten their task list allowing them to instead focus on their core business
activities.


#### Option 2: Integrate selectively.
tZERO strives to be an accommodative partner and a trading service provider to business and other trading parties. To
this end, tZERO makes a range of options available for more trade savy entities and service providers. tZERO allows
third-parties to selectively request the services and trading modules that they need. So, a third-party can pick and
choose among tZERO's trading service components and use those service to augment their existing operations.

This option delegates not the full set of trading service responsibilities to tZERO, but rather selectively request
service from tZERO. The third-party makes trade service request only for those modules and services that the third
party lacks or prefers those which the third-party prefer to rely on tZERO's tested and robust services.
